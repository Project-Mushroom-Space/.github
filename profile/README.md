# Project Mushroom

Project Mushroom started in November 2022 as a community-led effort to build a safe place on the internet. We are assembling a creator council that will help direct our efforts going forward. This is open to anyone who wants to help build a better online experience â€” free from harassment, free from bigotry, and one that promotes connection, mutual aid, and transformative action at a critical moment in history.

The name 'Project Mushroom' comes from the ground beneath our bodies. Mycelium is the part of a fungus that gathers nutrients, comprised of web-like threads. Like Rebecca Solnit writes in Hope in the Dark, a mushroom is the visible fruit of the work of billions of connections waiting for the perfect moment to rise up together.

We host two Mastodon instances:

- https://projectmushroom.social (Federated with spore.social only for a more intimate community)
- https://spore.social (Federated with the rest of Mastodon)

We also host a newsletter:
